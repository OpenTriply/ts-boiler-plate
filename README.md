### Prerequisites

- Install NodeJS
- Use latest NPM version (`sudo npm install -g npm@latest`)


### Setting up
- Install dependencies by running `npm install`
- Transpile the typescript to javascript by running `npm run build` (if you use the atom editor, you won't have to run this command each time as it'll automatically transpile each file you change via the editor)

###Running
- `npm run start`
